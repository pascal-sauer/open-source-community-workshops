### Lessons Learned from Organizing Community Workshops for Open-Source Tools

Pascal Sauer & Alex Hagen

notes:
https://events.hifis.net/event/1741/contributions/13920/
15 min presentation, 5 min questions

--

### setting the stage

- open source model/tool
- used by some externals, interest by more

- you organized workshop
  - with 15 participants
  - from all over the world
  - hybrid

- tech trouble, ignored setup instructions
- online participants stay muted & invisible

notes:
- ~ our situation
- hindsight: key questions/goals, decisions
- 1-2 tech support people, still slowed
- ask people to turn on camera
- eventually some participants started, others followed
  - have team join with camera

---

### main goal
- discuss, clarify, write down
- common understanding
- informs all further decisions
- how to measure success?

notes:
we didn't do this, but should have

--

#### strengthen knowledge
- improve understanding of the model and its results
- spark interest vs. provide in depth understanding
- support informed decision if this is the right tool
- basis for long-term cooperation

--

#### grow community
- enable people to
  - use and run model
  - develop and contribute

---

# key questions
- quite general
- informed by main goal

--

#### target audience
- open for all
  - unpredictable (prior knowledge, commitment)
  - heterogeneous audience
    - tech support required

--

- by invitation
  - more predictable, more control
  - no new people

--

- challenge as prerequisite
  - more effort (design challenge, evaluate handed-in solutions)
  - less people
  - more homogeneous, more committed
    - less tech support needed

notes:
successfully run the model once locally

--

#### participation fee
- less people, less accessible
- more commited audience
- allowed at institute? leftover money?

---

#### workshop format
- online
  - more people, accessible
  - potentially timezone trouble
  - less commited audience
  - challenge: camera off audience; who is following?

--

- in-person
  - less people, much less accessible
  - location required
  - direct access for tech help
  - better interaction/discussion, also outside sessions

--

- hybrid
  - more setup
  - danger: 2-class audience

---

#### where participants work
- local PC
  - heterogeneous systems (Windows, Mac, Linux)
  - no admin permission
  - super slow/outdated system
  - danger: pre-workshop setup ignored
    - lots of tech support needed

--

- provided system (virtual environment (ssh), hardware PC)
  - suitable system required
  - foreign system for participants

--

- virtual machine on PC (e.g. dockerfile)
  - less setup required
  - foreign system for participants

notes:
best or worst of both worlds?

---

#### resources
- people
  - who organizes workshop
  - presenters
    - one session per person
      - less work for each presenter
      - more coordination overhead
      - danger: sessions are not seamless (redundant or missing parts)
    - few presenters
      - more work for each presenter
  - tech support

--

- location
  - workshop room
  - breakout rooms
  - accomodation

- money
  - software licenses
  - catering, drinks

---

### what worked well
- expectation management (communicate goal)
- website (tutorials, slides, links)
- timetable

---

### summary
- clarify main goal
- consider ressources, key questions upfront
- prepare for complications
  - tricky setup problems
  - participants not committed, drop out
  - more time is needed

---
